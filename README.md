Resizer,  Markus Lehtonen

Resizer is yet another thumbnail creator and it uses Python 2.7.

How to use:
Your original image files should be in the same directory as the script (resizer.py). You will be prompted to enter the dimensions of your thumbnails. The script will save them in a subdirectory 'thumbnails' which will be created if not present before.
