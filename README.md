### Image-resizer

This script is yet another version for creating thumbails. PNG files are not supported.

### Requirements:
- Python 2.7
- PIL library

### How to use:
This script is used in the same directory as where your images are saved. You will be prompted to enter dimensions for your thumbnails. A subdirectory 'thumbnails' is created (if not already present) where the thumbnails will be saved.
